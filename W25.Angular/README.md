Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that includes npm (Node Package Manager), which is used to install Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) and other dependencies.

You can install Node.js and npm using the following commands in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
Step 2: Install Angular CLI
Angular CLI is a command-line tool used to create, manage, and build Angular projects. Install it globally using npm:

bash
Copy code
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
Step 3: Create a New Angular Project
Navigate to the directory where you want to create your Angular project and use Angular CLI to create a new project. Replace my-angular-app with your desired project name:

bash
Copy code
ng new my-angular-app
Follow the prompts to choose options like routing and stylesheet format (CSS, SCSS, etc.).

Step 4: Navigate to Your Angular Project
Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd my-angular-app
Step 5: Serve Your Angular Application
You can serve your Angular application locally using the Angular CLI development server. Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
ng serve --open
This command will compile your Angular application and open it in your default web browser. Any changes you make to your files will automatically trigger a recompilation and refresh the browser.s

DEFAULT LAYOUT not all
Opinionated Framework: Angular is a full-fledged framework, which means it provides a comprehensive solution with built-in tools and conventions for building large-scale applications. This can be beneficial for teams that prefer a structured approach and want everything integrated out-of-the-box.
Built-in Features: Angular comes with many built-in features, such as a robust CLI, dependency injection, routing, forms handling, and state management (with NgRx). This can streamline development and reduce the need for integrating third-party libraries.
TypeScript Support: Angular is built with TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript provides features like static typing, interfaces, and advanced tooling, which can improve code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity, especially in large projects.
Two-Way Data Binding: Angular uses two-way data binding, where changes in the model automatically reflect in the view and vice versa. While this can simplify development by reducing boilerplate code, it might also lead to performance overhead in certain scenarios.
Strongly Defined Architecture: Angular follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, where components, services, and modules play well-defined roles. This can make it easier to organize and maintain code, especially for teams with diverse skill sets.
Official Support: Angular is developed and maintained by Google, which provides long-term support and a roadmap for future updates. This can instill confidence in the stability and longevity of Angular-based projects.
